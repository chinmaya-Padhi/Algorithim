# ðŸ“š Daily Algorithm Learning Repository

This repository is my personal space for **daily algorithm study and practice**.  
Each day, I read, understand, and implement one or more algorithms â€” documenting my thought process, pseudocode, and final working code.

---

## ðŸ“… Goals
- **Read** one new algorithm per day.
- **Understand** the theory, step-by-step process, and edge cases.
- **Implement** it in code (Python, C++, or other languages I practice).
- **Document** my learnings for future reference.
